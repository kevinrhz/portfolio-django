        <h2>Background & Journey</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Phoenix, expecting to graduate in April 2026. My academic journey has been paralleled by continuous self-learning and practical application, particularly in the realm of data science and machine learning. I am driven by a desire to not just understand theoretical concepts but to apply them in creating tangible, efficient solutions. [cite_start] My experience includes managing high-volume shifts and optimizing service times at Tanoor Fayyed LLC, where I honed skills in communication, problem-solving, and versatility by working in multiple roles. [cite: 2, 3, 4, 5]
